  <h3 class="blogheading">Apple just launched an official $99 MagSafe battery pack for the iPhone 12 lineup</h3>
  <br>
  <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wPMzO_x_Zy9TPaEDa2m6yjQHXJc=/0x0:2052x1427/1820x1213/filters:focal(862x550:1190x878)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576515/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_9.56.00_AM.0.jpg" alt="" width= "600">
<p>Apple has launched the MagSafe Battery Pack for its iPhone 12 lineup. One of the magnetic batteries costs $99, and you can order one right now from Apple’s website. For me, the website is showing delivery between July 22nd and July 26th. <br><br>

Apple has released battery cases for iPhones in the past, but the new pack attaches to the iPhone 12 phones thanks to embedded magnets. And it will work with all four of the phones in the iPhone 12 family — the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max.</p>
<br>

<br>
While the iPhone 11 battery cases had a physical camera shortcut button, since this accessory is just an attachable pack, that means they don’t come with any other features besides giving you some extra juice for your phone. <br><br>

Apple says it charges with up to 5W of power, so the new pack won’t be the fastest way to charge your phone. In a support page, Apple also says the battery requires iOS 14.7 — a software update that’s not out yet. Since Apple’s website is showing delivery times for the battery pack for as early as July 22nd, it seems like that update will be out soon to support it <br><br>

Apple also offers a wallet that can stick magnetically onto the back of your phone as well as a MagSafe wireless charger.

    <br>
        <img src="https://image-cdn.hypb.st/https%3A%2F%2Fhypebeast.com%2Fimage%2F2021%2F07%2Fnike-dunk-low-halloween-on-foot-photos-dd3357-100-release-info-002.jpg?q=90&w=1400&cbr=1&fit=max" alt="" width= 600>

        <br>
      <p id="shoepost">In preparation for the spooky holiday, Nike (NYSE:NKE -0.14%) is releasing a new special edition Dunk Low “Halloween” which adds to this year’s chilling lineup along with the SB Dunk Low “Mummy.” <br>
<br>
The design follows a white, burnt orange, and black color scheme resembling the likes of the Air Jordan 1 “Electro Orange” and the Air Jordan 1 “Shattered Backboard” series. White leather fills up the toe box, quarters and collars with black overlays stitched over the shoe featuring a glow-in-the-dark print of various eyes. A burnt orange hue takes over the midfoot Swoosh, nylon tongue and collar lining. The white midsoles with a black contrast stitching sit over a bed of glow-in-the-dark outsoles to cap off the look. <br>
<br>
The Nike Dunk Low “Halloween” is set to release for $120 USD this October at select retailers and <a id="nike" href="nike.com">Nike’s official website.</a><br>
<br>
Elsewhere in footwear, CLOT teases another Nike Air Max 1 “K.O.D.” colorway.</p>

    <p class="blogcontent">I'm a huge fan of cars, in particular im a big fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_M3">BMW M3's</a>. I have owned 2 in my lifetime and most recently I sold mine in order to pay for my coding boot camp classes. Covid hit which delayed me from signing up but for Good Reason! A few months ago a friend told me about a wonderful opportunity to be able to get the education I needed for free! Now I can use the money on other things! (New project car perhaps?)</p>
